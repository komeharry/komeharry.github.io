## MESSAGE FROM KOME TO TECH EXPERT ACADEMY

I am super excited to take this bold step in my decision to transition to Tech.
This decision is not as easy as it seems, neither did it come as just a simple option of yes or no answer, rather, because i was certain of what exactly i want,
it required that I took a bold step in resigning from my position at the bank to enable my transition to Tech come to life.
This is because i realized it will require such a great dedication of my time, energy and focus to actualize this, i personally believe in giving your 100% or give nothing at all, hence, since i am 100% sure of what i want, i decided to give my 100%, and my job at the bank would not have made it possible, thus i resigned.
I have no regret.
Tech is something I had always had a passion for.
Immediately after graduating, I took an initiative to go into Data Analytics with the popular NINC tech institution here at my vicinity, but due to some personal challenges, this was abruptly put to a halt.
But now, I am so glad I took the bold step to resigning from my position at the bank to actualize this goal, 
i am even more excited that i get to do it with Tech Expert Academy cause i have heard so much of the academy's greatness, i only wish to have discovered it sooner. 
I cant wait to acquire the necessary knowledge needed with Tech Expert Academy to make me completely equipped for the next big chapter.
